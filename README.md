# Classes
This repository contains python program files constructed by myself to display my understanding of classes in python.

------
sms.py 
------
This program is a sms simulation program using a class called SMSmessage<br/>
This class receives three variables namely:</br>
    1. has_been_read - a bool for whether the user read a sms or not.<br/>
    2. message_text - for the receiving of a text message sent by the user.<br/>
    3. from_number - for the receiving of the number from which the text message comes.<br/>
The class holds various functions that return results based on user input. In short,<br/>
the program can send, receive, read, get, mark and delete sms's from a number.<br/>
