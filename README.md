# Classes
This repository contains python program files constructed by myself to display my understanding of classes in python.

------
sms.py 
------
This program is a sms simulation program using a class called SMSmessage<br/>
This class receives three variables namely:</br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>has_been_read</b> - a bool for whether the user read a sms or not.<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>message_text</b> - for the receiving of a text message sent by the user.<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>from_number</b> - for the receiving of the number from which the text message comes.<br/>
    
The class holds various functions that return results based on user input. In short,<br/>
the program can send, receive, read, get, mark and delete sms's from a number.<br/>

----------
myclass.py
----------
This is a programme that returns the following:<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The artist in a list.<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The albums of the list of a particular artist.<br/>

This program utilises a class with two functions.<br/>

----------
student.py
----------
This program computes the following:<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The average score of a student's grades.<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. It tests whether a student is a male or a female.<br/>
    
The program utilises a class called Student<br/>
The class hosts various fucntions for the computation of the needed outcomes.<br/>
